Replace this line with imperative summary

An awesome description of WHY you did this work, not HOW/WHAT it does.
The diff attached to commit should describe implementation (HOW) 
well-enough.

# [TICKET-12]

#------------------------------------------------^---------------------^
#                                              50^                   72^
# 1. Summary should be imperative (not past tense), 50 characters or
#    less, and not end with a period.
#
# 2. Description of commit should explain WHY a change was made and
#    lines should be wrapped to 72 characters.
